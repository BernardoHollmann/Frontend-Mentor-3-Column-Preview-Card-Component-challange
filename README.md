- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - This was a good one to practice a grid display page. When I first saw the design, I imediatly assossiate it with a display grid component type. I have never used this type of approach, so I had to understand how to implement it before using. However, It was incredible easy to work with grid. Most of the time I had in this project was for styling the components and with its responsivness. The display grid was very effective and time saving for setting the layout for samaller screens.
